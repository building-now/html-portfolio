Good morning my dude 😄 <br /><br />

I can’t believe it’s been over a decade since we first met back in 2013. 
Time really flies when you have an amazing friend like you by your side 😎<br /><br />
I still treasure all the memories we made together—whether it was exchanging ideas and laughs after class 
or attending those after-school programs... until our contact turned digital 👩‍💻🖨️. We managed to keep in touch somehow 😄<br /><br />

Even though life took us to different parts of the world, I’m so grateful for how we’ve stayed close. 
Your visit to Germany meant so much to me, and I can’t wait to finally take your invitation to visit you in the US someday soon. 
I know it’ll be just like old times when we meet again, catching up and sharing more laughs.

You’re such a special person in my life, and I’m so proud of everything you’ve accomplished. 
I hope this year brings you all the joy, love, and success you deserve. 
Can’t wait to see what life brings next—and hearing about your new adventures!<br /><br />

Have the best birthday ever—you truly deserve it!!! Now go pamper yourself today 👑
Miss you tons and sending you all the love and best wishes from Germany 🎂✨ <br /><br />

Big hugs,<br />
Your Coolest Bro 😎
